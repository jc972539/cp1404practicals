# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

61.9%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

In an office workspace during the day for forty minute intervals

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Making an effort to attend all classes and to catch up when I have missed something

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Not completing the online lecture videos before the seminar.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I have noticed that there are general administrative tasks or "work through examples" so we can get a better understanding of how to use the software. I spend the majority of the in-class timeslot completing this, so I intend to do this part beforehand and then I can focus on the assessed part of the practical/extensions

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Spending the class time productively and focussing on the task at hand
